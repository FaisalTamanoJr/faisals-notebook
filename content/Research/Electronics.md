## Steps in Studying Electronics

1. Understand the basics of a closed loop circuit
	- A circuit needs to be in a closed loop in order to run because it is the only condition where electrons flow.
	- A closed loop pertains to the path from the negative to the positive terminals of a battery.
2. Learn the basics of elementary electrical components
	- Get a grasp of the Ohm’s Law
	- Current is generated through the flow or movement off electrons; resistance hinders the flow of electrons; voltage generates current because it refers to the work needed to move the charges.
3. Participate in practical experiments
	- Supplement your knowledge by exposing yourself to circuits in real life, instead of restricting yourself to only learn the abstract theory.
4. Learn about the basics of common electrical components
	- Utilize good learning resources to understand the basics of the following components:
		- the resistor,
		- the LED,
		- the capacitor, and
		- the transistor.
5. Make use of transistors as switches
	1. Transistors are crucial components, and using them as switches can assist you in comprehending their nature.
6. Study soldering
	- Unlike breadboard prototypes, which are more fragile, soldering enables you to build long lasting products.
7. Assimilate information about capacitors and diodes
	- Exploring the behavior of capacitors and diodes is the first step to understanding more complicated circuits.
8. Take advantage of Integrated Circuits (ICs)
	- Learning how to use ICs can allow you to add more advanced features to your projects.
9. Design your own Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
	- Creating your own PCB can free you from some limitations, and allow you to creatively solve problems.
10. Introduce Microcontrollers to your projects
	- Microcontrollers open new possibilities for your projects: more advanced functionalities are simplified into lines of code instead of circuit components.

## Applications of Electronics in Automation and Computers

### Computers

Integrated circuits (ICs) are efficient circuits that are used due to their smaller size and costs compare to traditional electrical devices. For this reason, they can perform all functions of a computers central processing unit (CPU). They are valuable in the field of computers because of the microprocessor—a component in computers that serve as the CPU packaged into a single or more ICs.

One use of resistors are suppressing electromagnetic Interference (EMI), which computers utilize for their input and output ports. On the other hand, transistors assist computers by being fundamental components of ICs. Its most notable function is in generating binary bits for Boolean logic in computers. Lastly, capacitors register the information stored by the transmission channel in a computer.

### Automation

In the automotive industry, specialized ICs or microcontrollers are developed to control specific operations in embedded systems, enabling us to control the engine. Other than the automotive industry, the medical field make use of electronics by using operational amplifiers (op-amps) in medical devices for signal amplification and conditioning. In the military, diodes are utilized for designing communication devices.

## Fleming’s Oscillation Valve

Fleming designed a rectifying device by innovating Edison’s patented light bulb, and named it an *oscillation valve*. He gave it that name because of its resemblance with the behavior of valves in pumps that restrict gas or water to only move unidirectionally. The device could rectify electric currents and radio waves; as a result, it became pivotal in the development of future inventions, including radio, radar, supercomputers, and artificial intelligence.

## Vacuum Tube

### Filament

The filament (or heater) is a fundamental component in vacuum tubes. It is a thin wire that heats up and brightens when current passes through it. The heat is then used by the cathode.

### Cathode

The cathode is a component which is connected to a low or no voltage source, and produces electrons in the tube. Through *thermionic emission*, it frees electrons from itself, which is then controlled by the electric fields of other tube components. Furthermore, the electrons will serve as the source of the tube’s current.

### Anode

The anode (or plate), in contrast to the cathode, are connected to the highest voltage present in the amplifier. Its voltage difference with the cathode creates an electric field between them. Moreover, the electrons liberated by the cathode will become attracted to the positively charged anode. Conventionally, we describe the current flow opposite to the actual electron flow; consequentially, the current present in the vacuum tube is referred to as the plate current.

### Grid

The control grid is between the cathode and anode. It controls the electron flow by differentiating the voltage between itself and the cathode.

## Solid State Electronics

### Introduction

Solid-state electronics concerns devices that are semiconductors and replace moving parts. In the 1960s, it was used to shed light on the differences between the method of electric transfer between semiconductors and older vacuum tubes, highlighting the difference in how electrical signals move through solids and gases.

### Examples

1. Microprocessor chip
2. LED lamp
3. Solar cell
4. Charge coupled device (CCD)
5. Camera image sensor
6. Semiconductor laser

## Electrical Classifications of Matter

### Conductor

Conductors are materials where electrons can easily move from one atom to another when voltage is applied. This is due to the overlap between the conduction band and valence bands that make it easy for the valence electrons to become free electrons.

### Semiconductor

Semiconductors have moderate conductivity, meaning that its conductivity is between the extremes of a conductor and the extremes of an insulator. Despite the gap existing between the valence band and the conduction band, it is still thin enough to allow for the facilitation of electron movement.

### Insulator

Because of the larger gaps between the conduction and valence bands, insulator prevents energy to flow between objects. As a result, inductors are characterized by their lack of conductivity or inability to conduct electricity.

## Intrinsic and Extrinsic Semiconductors

Intrinsic semiconductors are purely made up of semiconductor material, which entails that there are no added impurities. Whereas, Extrinsic semiconductors are doped through the introduction of controlled impurities or dopants. Extrinsic semiconductors can be classified as either an N-type or P-type: N-type when its elements donate extra electrons and produce an excess of free electrons; P-type when it produces excess holes and accept electrons from the semiconductors.
