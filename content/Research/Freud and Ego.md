Sigmund Freud divides human personalities in three parts: the id, the ego, and the superego.

- **Id:** pertains to the aspect of personality that is intrinsic and unconscious.
- **Ego:** the aspect that stems from our *id* and is responsible behind our decisions. It is the middleground between id and superego, wherein it tries to satisfy our physical needs while adhering to social norms, rules, principles, and etc.
- **Superego:** guides our decisions using the standards we formed and acquired from people around us.
