## Introduction

- A prolific innovation ecosystem is the key to a successful innovation(s)
- Oxentia’s *The Elements of Review* provides a systematic approach for evaluating innovation ecosystems; it can identify the gaps in the market.
- It is good to have successful startups because it can integrate research-based technologies into enterprise-level systems

> [!INFO]- Startups
> Startups are companies at its early stages that sell a main product/service to meet a particular demand

- Innovation ecosystems are composed of elements which are classified into the following categories:
	1. Research (Universities)
	2. Government
	3. Businesses
	4. Third Sector (charities and enablers)

### Research and Technology Organizations (RTOs)

- Universities play a key role in innovation systems because they heavily contribute to research and development.
- 6 elements included in this category
	1. vice-chancellor
	2. university policy
	3. research activity
	4. research services
	5. proof of concept funds
	6. technology transfer office

> [!INFO] Technology transfer
> *Technology transfer* pertains to the commercialization of university research

- University researches are valuable sources for innovation. It can either be adopted by local communities or be commercialized.
- **Poor policy of technology transfer** can drive off foreign subsidiaries from linking with a domestic firm
- Philippines has good policies of technology transfer
	- Most universities support commercialization of their products
	- Existing laws involving the benefits of commercializing research products
	- Government and foreign organizations support Philippine researches
	- Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) are present in the country’s big universities

### Government

- Governments can encourage the creation of startup by providing tax incentives, funding, and benefits for individuals forming innovative businesses. Philippine laws and organizations that tries to do this include the following:
	- *Innovative Startup Act* (RA 11337)
		- This mandates the creation of the *Philippine Start-Up Development Program*—a program that gives incentives and benefits for innovative businesses.
		- Provision of the *Startup Grant Fund*
			- This exempts startups from taxes in their first two years of operation
	- *Tax Reform for Attracting Better and High Quality Opportunities* (TRABAHO) Bill
		- Provide incentives for registered companies that pursue innovation
	- *Innovation Council* (or DOST-PCIEERD)
		- Provides grants for startups
- Government challenges in promoting the creation of startups
	- No laws that incentivize early-age investors who invest from their own pockets

### Businesses

- Presence of businesses that closely work together in the country increases the chances of startups succeeding. This is because startups also need funds and connections to source materials and services.
- Connecting startups with big companies can foster their growth: they have access to training, they are incubated until they are ready to be invested for, and they are provided venture capital.
- Business networks also provide professional services that supplement the needs of an innovation system: they can allow startups to outsource some of their activities.

> [!INFO]- Venture Capital
> A *venture capital* is a form of private equity provided by firms to support a startup at its early stage.
>
> An *equity* is money provided that is to be returned to the shareholders once the assets are liquidated and debts are paid

### Third Sector

- This includes the following elements:
	- Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)
	- charities
	- foundations
	- not-for-profit companies
	- social enterprises
- These are organizations that supports and funds things (such as startups, innovations, and projects) that align with their goals.

## Methodology

The Elements of Review prompts evaluators to rate the performance of each element in each categories of innovation ecosystems:

| Universities           | Government                        | Businesses                | The Third Sector              |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Vice-Chancellor        | Tax Incentives                    | Business Networks         | Non-governmental Organization |
| Research Activity      | Grant Programmes                  | Innovative Tech Companies | Charity                       |
| University Policy      | Legislative Framework             | Business Angels           | Foundation                    |
| Research Services      | Public Procurement                | Seed and Venture Capital  | Not for Profit                |
| Proof of Concept Funds | Support, Clarity, and Consistency | Entrepreneurs             | Social Enterprise             |
| Tech Transfer Office   |                                   | Professional Advisers     |                               |

This paper used a **number rating to assess each element (1 for low performance and 3 for best performance)**.
