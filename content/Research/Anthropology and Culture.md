- # Anthropology
	- Anthropology looks at how biology and culture shape the self from a holistic perspective
	- It considers human experiences to be an interplay of both our genes and our sociocultural environment
		- *nature* refers to the genes
		- *nuture* refers to the sociocultural environment
- # Perceptions on self in different societies
	- Egocentric - suggest that although the self is a replica of all of humanity, it can still act on its own
		- an individual is distinct and have their own inherent characteristics
	- Sociocentric - suggest that the self is defined by their membership in a particular social group
- # Identities
	- People construct their social identities based on their similarities and differences with others
		- Self-identification may be attained by kinship, family membership, gender, age, language, and etc.—the social group a particular person belongs in or their *group identity*.
	- Identity toolbox - the features of a person’s identity that a particular person chooses to emphasize
	- Naming is a universal practice that provides an individual their social identity and grants them their birthright.
	- People are not born with an identity, it is something they develop.
	- Changes in identity usually involve rites of passage that prepare a person from changing between different identities
		- rites of passage refer to ceremonies that mark important transitional periods in a person’s life
- # Phases that mark changes in one’s status and identity
	- 1. Separation phase - people detach from their former identity to another
	- 2. Liminality phase - person transitioning into another identity
	- 3. Incorporation phase - incorporation of change in one’s identity
