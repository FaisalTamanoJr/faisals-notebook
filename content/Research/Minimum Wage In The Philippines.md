## Background

- As of March 2024, IBON Foundation claims that the national average daily minimum wage (440 PHP) is not enough to cover food and non-food costs of the typical family of five’s needs
	- the family living wage—computed using the National Wages and Productivity Commission’s (NWPC) minimum wage data and March 2024 inflation data from the Philippine Statistics Authority—averaged at P1,207, resulting in a national wage gap of P762.
- An analysis from Picodi Philippines found that the minimum wage in the country fails to keep up with the rising food prices, suggesting that some Filipinos may not be able to live off the amount earned from work.
