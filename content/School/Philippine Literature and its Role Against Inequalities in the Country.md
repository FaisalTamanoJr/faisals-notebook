Supporting Quotes

- **People who faced horrible conditions are the ones affected the most by strict drug policies**
	- Three weeks earlier, his assistant had emptied the cash register and split, taking boxes of expensive hair coloring products on the way out. The betrayal came on the heels of a huge blow. Ronnie’s straight male lover, whom he’d supported through college, had left to marry a girl he’d gotten pregnant.
- **People who, presumably, are not involved with drugs have bad moral character**
	- The whole town would watch him compete again, hundreds of his neighbors—who’d already written him off as a cautionary tale—would see him at his glamorous best, see him in a long gown, on that stage, spotlights beamed on him.
	- Ronnie had forgotten how nosy the neighbors could be.
	- Oliver was talking to him about a list they had at the community hall, a list of targets. Someone had tipped him off about Ronnie’s name being in it. Oliver was telling him now so he could leave town before they found him
		- “So this is why you wanted me out of Mintal.”
- **Drug users have good moral character despite their involvement**
	- “You know, gwaps, I can help you with that,” said Biboy.
		- Context: he saw the golden arm and uses his industrial arts background to selflessly help Ronnie
	- Ronnie had to close down the salon and move to a boarding house in a compound used mainly as an automobile workshop. To pay rent, he started going door-to-door, offering makeup, hair styling, even manicures and pedicures. Occasionally he would choreograph dance numbers for local government employees who needed “intermission numbers” for their parties.
	- “Don’t mind them, gwaps,” Biboy said. “Next to you, they look like clowns.”
	- The boy’s presence calmed him. Biboy was still there, the one who’d been with him from the start. He thought about where the boy would go after all this was done.
	- On stage Ronnie tried to move. He tugged and heard a rip—the armored sleeve had snagged on the hip of his dress. He fumbled to get the thing off but his large fingers couldn’t seem to close. He looked up and saw the boy’s long narrow body being pulled toward the end of the hall.
