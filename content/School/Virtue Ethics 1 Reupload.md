## Aristotelian Ethics

According to [[Aristotle]], the good life is one which is happy or [[fluorishing]],[^1] and for that to occur, one must live in accordance to their reason. A human’s unique essence is to live in accordance to their reason; thus, they must do so to become happy.

### Happiness and Virtues

Aristotle claims that happiness is each human’s ultimate goal because of its unique features:

- self-sufficient (i.e., it completes an individual’s life once it is satisfied)
- final (i.e., it is intrinsically good)
- attainable

To achieve happiness, one must exercise [[virtue]] by being good at serving their purpose. For example, a good workout routine ensures that their users reliably improve their physical, and/or physiological characteristics. For this reason, humans ought to exhibit excellence of reason (as beings whose proper functions consists of their capacities of reason and will).

The excellence of reason requires [[intellectual virtues]], while the excellence of will requires [[moral virtues]]. Intellectual virtues are acquired through studying and is manifested through knowledge. On the other hand, moral virtues are acquired through the formation and practice of habits, and is manifested through practical actions.

### The Golden Mean

Moral virtues lie between [[excessive]] and [[deficient]] forms. The table below sheds light on the excess, mean, and deficiency,

| Context                    | Excess       | Mean         | Deficiency     |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| Feeling of Confidence      | Rash         | Courage      | Cowardice      |
| Giving and Taking of Money | Prodigality  | Liberality   | Meanness       |
| Honor and Dishonor         | Empty Vanity | Proper Pride | Undue Humility |

> [!NOTE]
> There is no mean for an excess or a deficiency; for example:
> - There is no mean for cowardice.
> - There is no mean for greed.

## Confucian Ethics

### The Noble Person

Originally, the noble/superior person referred to individuals born in an aristocratic family. In addition, non-noble people could never obtain nobility, while noble people could never lose their nobility. [[Confucius]], however, altered the concept to only focus on an individual’s morality.

The more recent concept provides everyone the capacity to become noble solely by their character/conduct. In particular, one must do the following to acquire nobility:

1. act in harmony with the [[Mandate of Heaven]];
2. know his/her duties in their relationships and act accordingly; and
3. practice the cardinal/Confucian virtues.

#### The Mandate of Heaven

Although both Confucians and Taoists believe in the Tao—the ultimate principle that governs the universe and should guide every human’s actions—they disagree with how we could learn it. Taoists think that we can never completely understand it but only go with its flow. In contrary, Cofucians think that we could fully learn it through the *Mandate of Heaven*.

Confucians believe that we should aspire to educate ourselves about the *Way of Heaven* and conduct our lives accordingly. These mandate or way is independent of a God or gods for justification.

#### The Basic Relationships

Reciprocal responsibilities between parties underlie a harmonious relationship. If we assume that society consists of various relationships, then it is only in harmony when each relationship within it is also in harmony.

5 basic relationships from which other forms of relationships develop:

1. parent-child;
2. elder sibling-younger sibling;
3. husband-wife;
4. elder friend-younger friend; and
5. ruler-subject.

#### Rectification of Names

Rectification of names concerns the clarification of assigned duties based on the role an individual assumes in society. These roles are defined by a person’s name/designations (e.g., father, son, elder, and ruler). Disharmony arises when we we do not know and do our expected duties.

### The Confucian Virtues

1. **[[ren|Ren]] or benevolence or humaneness:** concerns selflessness; thus, a person practicing *ren* is compassionate.
2. **[[li|Li]] or propriety:** concerns proper conduct relative to a given situation. When it is internalized, it results to [[yi]].[^2]
3. **[[shu|Shu]] or reciprocity:** deals with acting in accordance to [[The Golden Rule]]: “Do not do unto others what you do not want others to do unto you.”
4. **[[xiao|Xiao]] or filial piety:** involves actions that display love, respect, and devotion to one’s family members, especially respecting and caring for one’s parents.
5. **[[wen|Wen]] or culture:** covers actions that foster one’s cultural appreciation.

> [!INFO]-
> Some scholars believe that the Confucian virtues consists of the following:
> 1. *ren* or humaneness;
> 2. [[yi]] or righteousness;
> 3. *li* or propriety;
> 4. [[zhi]] or wisdom; and
> 5. [[xin]] or faithfulness.

## Buddhist Ethics

### The Human Condition

#### General Features of the World

Humans lives in a world characterized by the following features:

- [[impermanence|Impermanence]]: everything changes.
- [[emptiness|Emptiness]]: nothing is intrinsic.
- [[dharma|Dharma]]: the world follows a causal order.
- [[dependent origination|Dependent Origination]]: everything is causally interconnected.

#### Basic Features of Human Existence

Humans live a life characterized by the following features:

- [[no-self|No-self]]: a person’s self always changes; consequently, an unchanging base like a soul does not exist. The various combination of physical and mental elements constitute the self.
- [[samsara|Samsara]]: the cycle of dying and being reborn.
- [[karma|Karma]]: the universe’s inescapable moral order: good actions will bear good consequences, while bad actions will bear bad consequences.
- [[suffering|Suffering]]: suffering is intrinsic to human existence. It arises from the basic features of the world and human existence.

#### Liberation from Suffering ([[Nirvana]])

For humans to liberate themselves from suffering, they must follow Buddha’s teachings.[^3] He introduced the path to enlightenment known as the [[Middle Path]]. Living it frees one from suffering; it is the path between the two extremes: *self-indulgence* and *self-denial*.

To live the Middle Path, one must accomplish all of the following:

1. know the [[Four Noble Truths]];
2. practice the [[Eight-fold Path]]; and
3. cultivate certain virtues through specific [[moral precepts]].

> [!INFO]
> After living a life of self-indulgence (as a prince) and self-denial (as an ascetic in the forest), [[Siddhartha Gautama]] achieved enlightenment by meditating under a bodhi tree for several days. This allowed him to end his suffering and become the [[Buddha]] or *The Enlightened One*.

### The Moral Teachings

#### The Four Noble Truths

1. Suffering exists
2. Suffering arises from craving
	- [[craving|Craving]] pertains to clinging desires—desires which get attached to their objects

3. Eliminating craving eliminates suffering
	- Cultivate non-clinging desires while eliminating clinging ones
4. To eliminate craving, follow the Eight-fold Path
